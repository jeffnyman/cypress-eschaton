Existential Note: this project is not intended to [immanentize the eschaton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanentize_the_eschaton). (Just in case anyone was worried.)

The _eschaton_ is from the ancient Greek term _ἔσχατον_ ‎(_éskhaton_). The word literally refers to the 'last thing' or even 'the end.' When construed as the latter, the phrase tends to refer to the final events, or last days, of history. In theological circles it also refers to the ultimate destiny of the human race.

A fairly grandiose set of meanings, to say the least. All my current project does, however, is indicate what I believe to be the 'last thing' I intend to put up regarding my experiments with development and automation around [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/).

## Project Setup

This project has modified the `cypress.json` file to look for tests in the `cypress/e2e` folder.

## Running the Project

You can execute the Cypress runner just as you would normally:

```
npx cypress open
```

You can also use the following command:

```
npm run cy:open
```

Likewise, if you want Cypress to execute tests in a headless mode, you can do the standard command:

```
npx cypress run
```

You can also do the following:

```
npm run cy:run
```
